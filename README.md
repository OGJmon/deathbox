#Instructions
deathbox.py is a GUI based game that can support 1-6 players. The game is played by entering the names of all of the players and taking turns. On your turn you have to guess higher, equal or lower on any card. The goal is to guess correctly three times in a row without messing up. If you guess incorrectly, you are subtracted in points the number of cards in the stack that was guessed on, and you restart trying to get three correct guesses in a row. If you successfully guess higher, equal, or lower three times in a row, no points are subtracted and it becomes the next player's turn. Whoever has the highest score when the deck runs out wins!

Alternatively the game can be played on the command line with deathboxLite.py
